        <p>Python tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Python. Our Python tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.

            Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.
            
            Python is an interpreted scripting language also. Guido Van Rossum is known as the founder of Python programming.
            
            Our Python tutorial includes all topics of Python Programming such as installation, control statements, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Modules, Exceptions, Date and Time, File I/O, Programs, etc. There are also given Python interview questions to help you better understand Python Programming.</div>

                Python is a general-purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
<p>Python is an easy-to-learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.</p><p>With its interpreted nature, Python's syntax and dynamic typing make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.
</p><p>Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. It is a multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.</p><p>We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed, so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.</p>
<p>Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language. It is utilized in several sectors and disciplines as a result.

    In Python, code readability and maintainability are important. As a result, even if the code was developed by someone else, it is easy to understand and adapt by some other developer.
    
    Python has many third-party libraries that can be used to make its functionality easier. These libraries cover many domains, for example, web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and more.</p>

<div class="sub"><p class="subhead">Why learn Python?</p>
    Python provides many useful features to the programmer. These features make it the most popular and widely used language. <br>We have listed below few-essential features of Python.

    <ul class="points">
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Easy to use and Learn:</strong> Python has a simple and easy-to-understand syntax, unlike traditional languages like C, C++, Java, etc., making it easy for beginners to learn.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Expressive Language:</strong> It allows programmers to express complex concepts in just a few lines of code or reduces Developer's Time.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Interpreted Language:</strong> Python does not require compilation, allowing rapid development and testing. It uses Interpreter instead of Compiler.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Object-Oriented Language:</strong> It supports object-oriented programming, making writing reusable and modular code easy.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Open Source Language:</strong> Python is open source and free to use, distribute and modify.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Extensible:</strong> Python can be extended with modules written in C, C++, or other languages.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. GUI Programming Support:</strong> Python provides several GUI frameworks, such as Tkinter and PyQt, allowing developers to create desktop applications easily.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Integrated:</strong> Python can easily integrate with other languages and technologies, such as C/C++, Java, and . NET.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Embeddable:</strong> Python code can be embedded into other applications as a scripting language.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Dynamic Memory Allocation:</strong> Python automatically manages memory allocation, making it easier for developers to write complex programs without worrying about memory &nbsp;&nbsp;management.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 11. Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks:</strong> Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, Django, and Flask, that can be used to solve a &nbsp;&nbsp;wide range of problems.</li>
        <li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 12. Big Data and Machine Learning:</strong> Python has become the go-to language for big data and machine learning. Python has become popular among data scientists and &nbsp;&nbsp;machine learning engineers with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and more.</li>

        <div class="header"><a name="syntax">Python Datatype</a></div>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="sub">
                Every value has a datatype, and variables can hold values. Python is a powerfully composed language; consequently, we don't have to characterize the sort of variable while announcing it. The interpreter binds the value implicitly to its type
                <pre>a = 5</pre>
                We did not specify the type of the variable a, which has the value five from an integer. The Python interpreter will automatically interpret the variable as an integer.

We can verify the type of the program-used variable thanks to Python. The type() function in Python returns the type of the passed variable.

Consider the following illustration when defining and verifying the values of various data types.
<pre>a=10  
b="Hi Python"  
c = 10.5  
print(type(a))  
print(type(b))  
print(type(c))  </pre>
<br><b>Output</b><pre>&lt;type 'int'> 
&lt;type 'str'>
&lt;type 'float'></pre>

            <p class="subhead"> Standard data types</p>
            A variable can contain a variety of values. On the other hand, a person's id must be stored as an integer, while their name must be stored as a string.
<br>
            The storage method for each of the standard data types that Python provides is specified by Python. The following is a list of the Python-defined data types.
            <ol class="points">
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Numbers</a></li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Sequence Type</a></li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Boolean</a></li>

                In this article, we are discussing Python Operators. The operator is a symbol that performs a specific operation between two operands, according to one definition. Operators serve as the foundation upon which logic is constructed in a program in a particular programming language. In every programming language, some operators perform several tasks

        <p class="subhead">Arithmetic Operators</p>Arithmetic operators used between two operands for a particular operation. There are many arithmetic operators. It includes the exponent (**) operator as well as the + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (divide), % (reminder), and // (floor division) operators.
      <br>Consider the following table for a detailed explanation of arithmetic operators.
